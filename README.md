### Hello! My name is Mend-Amar.
I am a masters student of Computer Science Engineering in [Budapest University of Technology and Economics](https://www.bme.hu/en) from Mongolia. I would love to contact anyone interested in math, computer science and machine learning ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

My main interests are:
- Computer Vision
- Deep Learning in CV
- Python - Geospatial libraries (`rasterio`, `geopandas`, `xarrays`), `PyTorch`
- Julia programming language - A fresh approach to numeric computing

What I've done so far:
- Check out my blog site at [here](https://mendebadra.github.io)
- Weed segmentation using k-means and spatial clustering measure (autocorrelation) from drone imagery for my bachelor's thesis. I have relevant experience in processing DJI Phantom P4 drone imagery for vegetation index etc.
- `Pluto.jl` notebook from a tutorial example from Deep Learning Bishop's book. (now posted as html in my blog site)
- Linux, nvim, bash scripting configs
